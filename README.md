# Yachay.ai-Task
This project takes on the goal to improve upon Yachay.ai's infrastructure to train a deep learning model to predict coordinates of individual texts.

The first suggested methodology on training the model is to look into the annotated data set on texts posted from across North America. We will provide you with a data set of texts, respective regions names and exact geopoints. The goal is to identify the location of the user: be that by predicting an exact geopoint, or make a broader, region-based estimate (for example: one studentâ€™s model returns exact coordinates of the building, while another student trains a classification model to predict a city rather than the exact geopoint).

No hard MSE or EER requirements, we're looking for innovative ideas for infrastructure development.
